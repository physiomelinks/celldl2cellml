# @physiomelinks/math-ast

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- First release. `@physiomelinks/bg2cellml` generates CellML 2.0 from BG-RDF bond graph models (CellDL documents or BG-RDF Turtle) in JavaScript, with libcellml.js and oxigraph as peer dependencies, keeping the `celldl2cellml()` interface of `@celldl/editor-python-tools`. Every BG-RDF example and variant simulates as the Python bg2cellml 0.11.2's CellML does, or, where Python has a bug, as a hand-worked reference does; the differences are listed in its README. `@physiomelinks/math-ast` reads, tidies and writes CellML's Content MathML, and `@physiomelinks/cellml-units` turns UCUM codes into CellML 2.0 units and compares and converts them with libCellML.
