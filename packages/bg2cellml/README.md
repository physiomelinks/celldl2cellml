# @physiomelinks/bg2cellml

Generates CellML 2.0 from [BG-RDF](https://github.com/CellDL/BG-RDF) bond graph models, in JavaScript.

It ports the Python [bg2cellml](https://github.com/CellDL/BG-Tools) (v0.11.2) so the CellDL Editor and PhLynx don't need Pyodide, which is about 24 MB of downloads. It keeps the `celldl2cellml()` interface of `@celldl/editor-python-tools`, so switching should only need a change of import.

> [!WARNING]
> This is an early skeleton. The RDF wrapper, SPARQL queries, bond network and CellDL extraction work, and the framework loads in full: domains, element templates, junctions and composites. Loading models, and generating CellML, aren't implemented yet.

## Usage

The WebAssembly modules, libcellml.js and oxigraph, are peer dependencies. The host application loads them once and passes them in.

```js
import createLibCellML from 'libcellml.js'
import * as oxigraph from 'oxigraph'                 // in a browser: oxigraph/web.js, after `await init()`
import { Converter } from '@physiomelinks/bg2cellml'

const converter = new Converter({ libcellml: await createLibCellML(), oxigraph })

converter.loadFramework({
  ontology: ontologyTurtle,                          // BG-RDF schema/ontology.ttl
  templates: { 'electrical.ttl': electricalTurtle },  // BG-RDF templates/*.ttl
})
// or, from statements already in an RDF store, such as the CellDL Editor's:
converter.loadFramework({ quads: store.match(null, null, null, null) })

const { cellml, metadata, issues, exception } = await converter.celldl2cellml(celldlSvg, {
  sourceUri: 'https://example.org/rc.celldl',
  metadata: true,
})
```

## Layout

| Path | Contents | Python original | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `src/converter.ts` | `Converter`: loads the framework, runs `celldl2cellml` | `editor-python-tools` glue | Done (calls stubs) |
| `src/celldl.ts` | `extractBgRdf`: Turtle from a CellDL SVG | `cli/bgtool get_bgrdf` | Done |
| `src/rdf/` | `RdfGraph` over oxigraph, namespaces, SPARQL queries | `rdf/`, query strings | Done |
| `src/framework/` | Domains, element templates, junctions, composites | `bondgraph/framework*.py` | Done |
| `src/model/network.ts` | `BondNetwork`, the directed graph of ports and junctions | networkx `DiGraph` | Done |
| `src/model/model.ts` | Elements, junctions, bonds and their equations | `bondgraph/model*.py` | Stub |
| `src/cellml/` | CellML 2.0 through libCellML, plus metadata | `cellml/__init__.py` | Stub |

## Differences from the Python version

- **CellML 2.0, written by libCellML.** It is validated and analysed before it's returned.
- **Units are converted.** Prefixed units work, and values are scaled to their variable's units. See `@physiomelinks/cellml-units`.
- **Known bugs fixed.** Bond labels and bond counts work, ports with only outputs get the right expression, and plain numbers such as `10.0` are accepted as values (Python rejects them under oxigraph). They're listed at the top of `src/model/model.ts`.
- **A bad declaration doesn't sink the framework.** A domain or element template with a problem is reported and left out; the others still load. Python stops at the first problem.
- **Templates are checked more closely.** Every parameter and variable must appear in the constitutive relation (Python only compares counts), and ports without a direction, duplicate ports and duplicate names are reported (Python drops or overwrites them).
- **An ambiguous element class is reported.** An element given as a class and domain (`bgf:Reaction` in `bgf:Chemical`) where the domain has more than one template of that class finds nothing, and `templateIssue()` says which templates it could be. Python silently uses the last by IRI.
- **A template's `rdfs:label` is its `label`.** Python holds it as the template's symbol, which nothing else uses.
- **Domain constants, and template parameters and variables, are sorted by name.** Python's order depends on its oxigraph build and how it orders blank nodes.
- **The framework can come from any RDF store.** `loadFramework({ quads })` takes oxigraph quads or those of any RDF/JS library, from any named graphs, and gives the same framework as Turtle.
- **Output text differs.** The equations are the same mathematically, but terms may be ordered differently. Parity is checked by simulation.
